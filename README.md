# Bread Mold Datasets
Datasets of 50x microscopic images of bread with and without mold for the fungi detection task

The datasets include 2,983 50x microscopic images of white sandwich bread and whole wheat bread made for the fungi detection task. There are two classes: 0 (no mold) and 1 (moldy). Each dataset is divided into a training set, a validation set, and a test set.
